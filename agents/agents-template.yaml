# Generic Agent System Configuration Template
# 
# This YAML file defines your multi-agent system.
# Agents are created automatically from this configuration.

# Define your agents
agents:
  # Each agent needs a unique ID (lowercase, no spaces)
  example_agent:
    # Model to use (optional, defaults to gpt-4)
    model: gpt-4
    
    # Temperature (optional, defaults to 0.7)
    temperature: 0.7
    
    # Agent instructions/prompt
    # Focus on WHAT the agent should do, not HOW to use tools
    # Agents automatically receive conversation history with previous agent outputs
    instructions: |
      You are the Example Agent.
      
      Your role is to help users with example tasks.
      Be helpful and concise.
      
      IMPORTANT: Check for [Previous Agent Output] sections in the conversation.
      Use data from previous agents instead of making duplicate API calls.
      
      Today's date: {{date}}
    
    # Tools this agent can access (optional)
    # List the tool categories from Arcade (e.g., Jira, Sharepoint, etc.)
    # The agent will automatically discover available tools and how to use them
    tools:
      - ExampleTool
  
  # Another agent example
  helper_agent:
    instructions: |
      You are the Helper Agent.
      
      You assist with general questions and tasks.
      
      Today's date: {{date}}
    
    # No tools specified = no tool access
  
  # Supervisor agent (routes requests to other agents)
  supervisor:
    instructions: |
      You are the Supervisor Agent.
      
      Analyze the user's request and route to the appropriate agent:
      - example_agent: For example-related tasks
      - helper_agent: For general help and questions
      - COMPLETE: When the request has been fulfilled
      
      IMPORTANT:
      - Analyze the ENTIRE conversation including all previous agent outputs
      - Previous agents may have retrieved data that subsequent agents need
      - Route to the next agent that needs to act on the data
      - Only return COMPLETE when all requested actions are done
      
      Look at the conversation history. If an agent has already responded
      (shown as "agent_name: response"), only route again if needed.
      
      Respond with ONLY the agent ID or COMPLETE.

# Routing configuration
routing:
  # Which agent acts as the supervisor/router
  supervisor: supervisor
  
  # Maximum routing iterations before stopping
  max_iterations: 10
